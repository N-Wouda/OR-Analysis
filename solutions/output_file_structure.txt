The output file should be named "oracs_i.csv", where i should be replaced by the right instance number. Hence, the solution of each instance is stored in a separate file. It should be formatted as follows:

On the first line: Your group number
On the second line: The instance number
On the third line: Number of vehicles used

Then, for every vehicle, every node visited by that vehicle, and every stack of that vehicle, you should print the following comma-separated line:
Vehicle index, Node, Stack index, Stack content (front to rear) upon leaving the node

NOTES:
1. No comma at the end of each line
2. No spaces before or after commas
3. Vehicles are indexed as "Vi", where i is the vehicle number
4. Stacks are indexed as "Si", where i is the stack number
5. Stack content must be represented as "di", to represent deliveries to customer i, or "pj", to represent pickups from customer j.
6. Stack content must be ordered from front of the vehicle to the rear.
